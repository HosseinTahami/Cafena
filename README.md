# 🌟 CafeShop Adventure: The Quest for the Ultimate Django Fullstack Project 🌟

Welcome, young Django developers, to the CafeShop Adventure! You have been selected to embark on a thrilling journey to create the ultimate Django full-stack project. CafeShop, the most popular coffee shop in the mystical land of Pythonia, needs your expertise to build an online menu and staff panel. 

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a fully functional web application that will allow customers to browse the cafe's menu, place orders, and earn rewards, while also enabling staff members to manage orders, view sales analytics, and update the menu. The Product Manager, Pourya Mansouri, has called upon you to take on this quest, and the four great Teacher Assistants, Fateme Alimirzaei, Mahdi Mirzaei, Milad Hoseinzadeh, and Hananeh Falah, will guide you through this exciting journey.

Your task is divided into three sections, each with a score of 100 points. Each section will take one week to complete, and at the end of each week, you will deliver your work. You will also follow the Agile methodology in weekly sprints, with one team member serving as the Scrum Master.

To encourage quality work, thorough testing, and documentation, we expect the test coverage to be over 95%, and each group must create a README file for their GitHub repository that explains the project and provides setup and run instructions.
